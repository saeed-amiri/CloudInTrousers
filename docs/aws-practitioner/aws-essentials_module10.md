# Module 10:
- Summarize the six pillars of the **Well-Architected Framework**.  
- Explain the six benefits of cloud computing. 

## The six pillars of the **Well-Architected Framework**:
### 1. **Operational Excellence**:
- The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
- The operational excellence pillar includes the ability to monitor, incident response, and learning from failures.
### 2. **Security**:
- The ability to protect data, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
- The security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
### 3. **Reliability**:
- The ability of a system to recover from failures and meet customer demands.
- The reliability pillar includes the ability to recover from failures and meet customer demands.
### 4. **Performance Efficiency**:
- The ability to use IT and computing resources efficiently.
- The performance efficiency pillar includes the ability to use IT and computing resources efficiently.
### 5. **Cost Optimization**:
- The ability to avoid unnecessary costs.
- The cost optimization pillar includes the ability to avoid unnecessary costs.
### 6. **Sustainability**:
- The ability to minimize the environmental impact of cloud services.
- The sustainability pillar includes the ability to minimize the environmental impact of cloud services.
## The six benefits of cloud computing:
### 1. **Cost Savings**:
- The ability to reduce costs by using cloud services instead of on-premises infrastructure.
### 2. **Speed and Agility**:
- The ability to quickly provision resources and scale up or down as needed.
### 3. **Performance**:
- The ability to use the latest technology and infrastructure to deliver high performance.
### 4. **Security**:
- The ability to use the latest security measures and best practices to protect data and systems.
### 5. **Reliability**:
- The ability to use redundant systems and backup solutions to ensure high availability.
### 6. **Scalability**:
- The ability to quickly scale up or down as needed to meet changing demands.
