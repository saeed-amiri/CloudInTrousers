# Clouds Basic:
It is on-demand delivery of IT resources (storage, compute power, databases) over the internet. Instead of managing the hardware, clouds providers offer services for rent like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Cloud Service Models:
There are three main types of the cloud computing
* `IaaS` Infrastructure as a service: Virtual servers, networking, and storage (e.g., AWS EC2, Google computing Engine)
* `PaaS` Platform as a Service: Provides a platform for developers to build applications (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine)
* `SaaS` Software as a Service: Fully managed application available via the internet (e.g., Gmail, Dropbox. AWS Workspaces)

## Cloud Deployment Models:
* Public Cloud: services are owned and operated by a third-party (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
* Private Cloud: Infrastructure dedicated to one organization, usually on-premises (For Banking, Governments, Healthcare)
* Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds

## The future:
* Processing data closer to where it's generated
* Server-less Computing for running code without managing servers (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
* AI and ML - Cloud platforms providing AI models and processing power (Google Vertex AI, AWS SageMaker)
* Quantum Cloud Computing - Future tech that uses quantum physics for computing (IBM Quantum, AWS Braket)
